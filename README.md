## The MVP

The minimal viable product for this project is to have a website with a home page that customers can then navigate from to view products all together or in categories, they will be able to select products to view more information about them and add products to their cart on either of these pages, they can also view their cart and increase the quantity of items if they would like too and proceed to checkout which will take them to the payment page where they can enter shipping details and payment details.
