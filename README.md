# AMS-QA-Training-Project

### This is a store front workshop for QA Training

#### This will be used as documentation for the QA Store project. I have decided to design a store front webpage based on the requirements laid out in the project brief description, creating a shop that sells plants letting users navigate the website pages, view products, add them to cart and checkout

## The MVP

The minimal viable product for this project is to have a website with a home page that customers can then navigate from to view products all together or in categories, they will be able to select products to view more information about them and add products to their cart on either of these pages, they can also view their cart and increase the quantity of items if they would like too and proceed to checkout which will take them to the payment page where they can enter shipping details and payment details.

## Install requirments folder for imports.
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

#### Run app.py to check if webpage will load.

```bash

python3 app.py

```

#### Run create.py to check if code is working.

```bash

python3 create.py

```
