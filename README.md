# AMS-QA-Training-Project

### This is a store front workshop for QA Training

#### This will be used as documentation for the QA Store project. I have decided to design a store front webpage based on the requirements laid out in the project brief description, creating a shop that sells plants letting users navigate the website pages, view products, add them to cart and checkout

#### Install requirments folder for imports.
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

#### Run app.py to check if webpage will load.

```bash

python3 app.py

```

#### Run create.py to check if code is working.

```bash

python3 create.py

```
